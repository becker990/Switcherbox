Switcherbox project

-whatis:
    
    Switcherbox is an interpreter to make possible
    an easy way to write scripts to control switches with the 
    parallel port. It´s goal is to be a cheaper and easier Arduino. 


Language:
    -syntax:(this sintax may change, for Turing complete language)
        will have a single form sintax: "C N"
        where C is command and N switch number
        making default 0 for all switches

    -commands(switcherbox features):

        -"l" or "L" is for on
        -"d" or "D" is for off
        -"i" or "I" is for inverting current state
        -"e" or "E" is for rotating left
        -"r" or "R" is for rotating right
        -"w" or "W" is for wait a given N time 
        
-todo:

    -DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO DO THE CIRCUITRY!!!11!!
    -further dev on a Turing-complete language
    -low current box
    -high current box
    -interface making high current box an expansion
